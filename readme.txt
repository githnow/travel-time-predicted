# TTP outputs a list of earthquakes from various catalogs.     #
# Calculates the arrival times of seismic waves                #
# at a particular seismic station, based on a set of basic     #
# parameters of the seismic event. Such as: coordinates        #
# (longitude, latitude), depth, magnitude.                     #
# Calculates the delta from the earthquake to seismic station  #
# and the distance between the two points on the worldmap.     #
# Shows the hodograph graphically for different depths.        #
# Saves the event from the database to test screen for replay. #
